<h2><u>FEELING LOST?<br>SEEKING ADVICE?<br>LOOKING FOR A SIGN?</u><br></h2>
<p>MESSAGES FROM THE UNIVERSE COME IN MANY FORMS;<br>
THIS SITE MAY CONTAIN ONE FOR YOU... WHY RISK MISSING IT?</p><br>realities can be controlled through the altered perception of real monocultural relationships. this undeniable truth is self evident through the seeing minds eye. you will never be real, and in turn, that verifies your existence. seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, smelling being. all of these things are unifyingly the same. this grouping of senses is "reality" as we know it. <br/>for context: imagine yourself now looking at a tv screen. all you're looking at are pixels on a screen, but your mind interprets that as reality. this is your "perception". now imagine yourself really seeing reality, with your own two eyes. what happens when you look away from that reality, like when you look away from a tv? what happens? you will break through. you see true reality. it can not be seen, it can not be comprehended, and yet it is always there. what is it? is it even real? of course it is. its reality. its life, it's living. you wouldn't be reading this  if it wasn't. and yet, has anyone ever seen it? that is the question, the question that holds the answer to life as we know it. <br/><br/>will you be the first to "See" reality? of course not,, but maybe you will. maybe you will be the first person to truly open their eyes and see the real world, wake up. wake up from this enteral dream. i know you can do it. i know you are capable, just take the first step. how hard can it be? you wake up from being asleep every morning with no effort at all. and yet no one has ever woken up from reality. this is the undeniable truth of the universe. the truth everyone looks for, the truth that has been sought after for all this time. the truth beyond life beyond reality, beyond existence. this is the truth. but, now that you know, what will you do? how will you harness this truth how will you utilise your newfound knowledge? will you even do anything? its up to you. everyone wants to be different, and its beautiful in its own way, but how will you be different? will you go beyond the crowd? will you exceed all expectations? or will you just blend in, be the same, and never truly wake up? these are the questions i pose to you. <br/><br/>have you ever gone to sleep while you're dreaming? what do you see? is it a dream inspired by the context of your previous dream? or is it something beyond a dream? the same goes for waking perception. what if you were to wake up a second time? is this reality just a dream inspired by the reality beyond ours? if so, what differences are compared to this reality? in a dream sometimes you can fly, bend it to your will. in reality, you can see, you can laugh, you can cry. what restrictions await in the reality beyond ours? or does it change entirely? tell me, can you remember the exact moment when you fall asleep? can you remember the moments leading up to the beginning of your dream? can you remember being born? can you remember what it was like before you were born? when did you as a person begin existing? none of these questions have answers, which is why you need to wake up. realise your reality, take grip and be the controller of your own dream. open your eyes to the true world, your waking consciousness, your true reality. a dream is only out of your control if you allow it.
<br/><br/><br/>
bouncing, bumbling, infinite realities beyond your own. whos objective subjective reality matches yours? no ones. subjectivity will never be truly perceived by anyone else. the more you strive for it, the further away its "fabric" is, the easier it becomes to see. a single point within an infinite sum of vectors and polygons, what truly is "it"? is it the concept of it? or is it something objective? these unrelenting questions will eventually be the answer to life as we, you and i know it. its there, it's right on the cusp, and is and has been for centuries. the answers will always be one word away from the truth, and its beautiful.<br/><br/> every decision you make leads to a different reality, and every reality leads to a different decision. does the same happen for every dream? if so, it can only be assumed that this phenomenon occurs for every waking moment. this also creates the question, are the people in your dreams real? do they have their own dreams? or are they simply a part of your subconscious? have you ever met someone you've known before in a dream? someone you hold dear? is it even accurate to their own perception of the world? when you're in a dream how many fingers do you have? is it 10, five, or IIIIII? what time is it right now? look at a clock. tell the nearest person to you. is it in the morning or afternoon? maybe its 12:00am on the dot. is it the dawn of a new day? or the sorry ending of a long night? time is a point. do not be ignorant. as all things are brief, so to are they infinite. is an infinitesimally small quantity in fact small? or is it just a concept bought into the human psyche making excuses? <br/><br/>a world outside our own exists, dwarfing ours by thousands of times. and yet, we are bigger than it, and it is bigger than us. this world, this fantasy land, is this plane of existence really out of our grasp? or is it sitting right in front of hundreds of eyes. one with an open mind may peer beyond the atomic veil, and see this world if not for a moment, for infinity. the spaces between our own are what make up the fibres of the universe, and in turn perception. may you see past your own perception, into the in between, you will finally be greeted with an unreachable destination. all of everything has already happened, and yet nothing at all. what happens when you divide by two enough to permanently raise the initial subject? where did the extra components come from? the split ends sinched between crossed paths. these are the questions. <br/><br/>make yourself truly lucid, for your eyes are not open, nor are your neural self's. create a seam and delve within it, split the hairs of an unfathomably sharp edge. make yourself aware, and known to the places in between. your path is not certain. when did you last go to sleep, do you remember the instant you slipped between life and death? lest you erase these moments from your own neural landscape, and leave sinkholes for yourself to inevitably fall down, to maybe never escape from. forget yourself, forget your mind, forget your consciousness, and be for the first time in your life, truly free. i sincerely hope you can awake from this dull slumber, and see the amazingly saturated spectrum of unseen colour. and may your trip be one of success. fairwell.
